      "p1": "Hi! I'm Pau Lefler, founder of ELYON STUDIOS BCN. I'm a musician, pianist, singer, vocal coach, composer, and music producer based in Barcelona. My passion for music has led me to build a diverse and multifaceted career, combining solid academic training with years of hands-on experience across various areas of the music industry.",
      "p2": "I hold a degree in Musicology from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), I am a professional singer trained at the Liceu Conservatory, and I also earned a Modern Music and Jazz degree from Taller de MÃºsics (ESEM). This education has allowed me to explore music from multiple angles: from theory and historical analysis to performance, composition, and modern improvisation.",
      "p3": "In addition, I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Film Scoring and Soundtrack Composition at EARTES (NEXO). Through this program, I gained extensive experience in music production, sound engineering, and mixing, working on projects that required the highest standards of technical and creative quality. This background has shaped my ability to combine cinematic storytelling, sound design, and emotional depth in every production.",
      "p4": "A key aspect of my work is my background as a vocal coach, a role Iâ€™ve been passionately dedicated to for over 12 years. This has given me a deep understanding of the human voice and of the artistic and technical needs of singers. As a producer, this becomes a great advantageâ€”I can work closely with vocalists throughout the entire creative process: from vocal composition to final recording, helping them bring out their full potential in every track."
    },
    "description2": "At ELYON STUDIOS BCN, I strive to offer a professional, welcoming, and inspiring environment where every project is treated with the utmost attention to detail. My mission is not only to deliver high-quality music productions, but also to provide artists with a transformative and empowering creative experience."
